Generative AI-powered Chatbot for SOPs
This project is a generative AI-powered chatbot that has been trained using internal documents about Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The bot is capable of answering queries related to SOPs in real time, offering valuable insights into operational processes.

🛠️ Features
AI Model: Powered by Llama from Hugging Face, fine-tuned using a comprehensive dataset of internal SOP documents.
RAG Pipeline: Implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline using FAISS to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
User Interface: Developed with Streamlit for a seamless, interactive user experience.
Local Hosting: Hosted locally using Ollama, ensuring data privacy and fast response times.
